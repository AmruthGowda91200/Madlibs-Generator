================ How the Code Works =============

Reading the Story from File:


with open("story.txt", "r") as f:
    story = f.read()
Opens story.txt for reading.
Reads the entire content into the story variable.
Closes the file automatically after reading.
Finding Placeholders:


words = set()
start_of_word = -1
target_start = "<"
target_end = ">"

for i, char in enumerate(story):
    if char == target_start:
        start_of_word = i

    if char == target_end and start_of_word != -1:
        word = story[start_of_word:i+1]
        words.add(word)
        start_of_word = -1
Initializes an empty set words to store unique placeholders.
Uses start_of_word to track the start index of placeholders.
Loops through each character in story:
Marks the start index when < is found.
Extracts the word from start_of_word to i when > is found and adds it to words.
Prompting User for Inputs:


answers = {}

for word in words:
    answer = input("Enter a word for " + word + ": ")
    answers[word] = answer
Initializes an empty dictionary answers to store user inputs.
Prompts the user for input corresponding to each placeholder in words.
Stores the user input in answers with the placeholder as the key.
Replacing Placeholders with User Inputs:


for word in words:
    story = story.replace(word, answers[word])

print(story)
Iterates over each placeholder in words.
Replaces occurrences of each placeholder in story with the corresponding user input from answers.
Prints the final modified story.
